    During my time at UC Santa Barbara, I took a variety of classes offered between the department of Computer Science and the department of Electrical Engineering. My team's capstone project was called Kwik-E-Kart, where we designed a printed circuit board that integrated Bluetooth and an RFID reader to read tags on products to know when an item had been inserted into or removed from the basket of a shopping cart. We designed an Android app to connect to the device via Bluetooth to keep a digital receipt of those items. We won the award for UCSB Best Computer Enginering Capstone Project of 2011.
    
    Outside of coursework, I participated in undergraduate research in a robotics lab through the department of Mechanical Engineering, where I reverse-engineered the electrical inputs to a motor control system for a motorized wheelchair.

    I was the President of the UCSB chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and participated on the board of Engineering Student Council.

    My success in my coursework and as an on-campus leader led me to being selected as the 2011 Student Commencement Speaker for the College of Engineering.
