    I use Jira at my dayjob on a daily basis. The members of my team with a last name nearing the end of the alphabet were always tired of having to go last, and I was looking for a fun little project to learn how to write a browser extension. It seemed like a match made in heaven.

    The extension works on Firefox and Chrome. It shuffles the assignee swimlanes on the sprint board, and it brightens up the day of the Williamsons, Youngs, and Zimmermans of the world.
