      <p>Hello! My name is Sergio. In my dayjob, I’m primarily a software engineer (mostly C++), am deeply involved in project planning for the products my team owns, and lead an organization focused on networking and professional development within Intel. I love working with people to figure out how to best solve their problems, especially if the solution involves software.</p>

<p>I spend weekends taking pictures, playing board games, and reading up on whatever catches my interest at the time.</p>

</p><p>I use Jira at my dayjob on a daily basis, and the members of the team with a last name nearing the end of the alphabet were always tired of having to go last. It seemed like a match made in heaven.</p>

<p>The extension works on Firefox and Chrome. It shuffles the assignee swimlanes on the sprint board, and it brightens up the day of the Williamsons, Youngs, or Zimmermans of the world.</p>

      <p>September 2011 - August 2013</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>I have had the opportunity to wear many hats in my time at Intel. I started as a Hardware Application Engineer, working with Intel’s major customers to integrate and debug our chipsets on their motherboards, specifically HP Enterprise. This involved both debugging in a laboratory and writing lots of external documentation. I found that some of our documentation could be more easily understood using software tools, so I designed them. I found I loved writing software so much, I decided to trasnition to a full time software position.</p>

<p>As a Graphics Software Engineer, I started maintaining and improving a validation graphics driver used to simulate synthetic content on a graphics simulator. Again, I found areas that could be improved or automated, like generating code directly from our specifications, tagging blocks of code to coordinate turning new features on and off between our toolchain, or using software to bridge different databases containing bugs and features into a unified backlog.</p>

<p>I also participate in Agile as a Scrum Master for multiple teams in my organization and as the Product Owner for my team of 12 developers that work on multiple tools that support an ever-growing number of products in flight.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>I coordinated the Summer Institute of Mathematics and Science, where 24 incoming freshmen spent two weeks at UC Santa Barbara engaging in an intensive schedule featuring academic preparation, professional development, educational presentations, and research projects. It was a great way for me to give back becuase SIMS was a great resource for me when I was an incoming freshman.</p>

I spent the second summer writing an error parser to generate reports from fuel flow simulations for the 737 program. The coolest part of working at Boeing was definitely getting to eat lunch while watching an assembly line assemble Boeing 737s.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>During my time at UC Santa Barbara, I took a variety of classes offered between the department of Computer Science and the department of Electrical Engineering. My team’s capstone project was called Kwik-E-Kart, where we designed a printed circuit board that integrated Bluetooth and an RFID reader to read tags on products to know when an item had been inserted into or removed from the basket of a shopping cart. We designed an Android app to connect to the device via Bluetooth to keep a digital receipt of those items. We won the award for UCSB Best Computer Enginering Capstone Project of 2011.</p>

<p>Outside of coursework, I participated in undergraduate research in a robotics lab through the department of Mechanical Engineering, where I reverse-engineered the electrical inputs to a motor control system for a motorized wheelchair.</p>

<p>I was the President of the UCSB chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and participated on the board of Engineering Student Council.</p>

<p>My success in my coursework and as an on-campus leader led me to being selected as the 2011 Student Commencement Speaker for the College of Engineering.</p>
